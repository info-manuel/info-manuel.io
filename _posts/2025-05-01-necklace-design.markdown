I want to gift something hand-made to my wife, the idea is to create a neclkace that holds a coin without the need of damaging it (drill a hole/solder a hook) 

* Coin dimensions: Diameter 27mm, thickness 2.1 mm.

A picture with the initial design:

*Drawn in [ExcaliDraw](https://excalidraw.com)*

After some tinkering with [FreeCad](https://www.freecad.org), I decided to constrain the first part of the object like this:
![part 1 constrained](/assets/images/Design-Constrained_part1.png)

Then, it is very easy to create the 3d design with **FreeCad**:
![3d_part1](/assets/images/3d_part1.png)

You will notice two main differences against the original design:

1. The pin is not centered, but it extends to the edges
2. There is no hole

Both are driven by ease of casting reasons, it is easier to create an object like this and then file the excess than to create a mold with that small and difficult geometry.

**Simplify the Z axis geometry in the mold to improve the chances of success!**

....In progress....
