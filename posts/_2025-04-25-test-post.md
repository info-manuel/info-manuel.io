# My First Blog Post

Hello, world! This is my first blog post using the Jekyll Minima theme on GitHub Pages.

## Why I Started This Blog

I wanted to share my thoughts and experiments with web development. The Minima theme provides a clean, responsive design that’s perfect for getting started quickly.

## What’s Next?

Stay tuned for more posts about Jekyll, GitHub Pages, and other cool web technologies!

Happy blogging!
