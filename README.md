## AI in Daily Life

### Virtual Assistants
AI-powered assistants like **Siri**, *Alexa*, and ~~Google Assistant~~ are now household names. They handle tasks with ease:

- 📅 Set reminders
- 🎶 Play your favorite music
- 🏠 Control smart home devices

> “Alexa, turn on the lights!” — A phrase that’s become second nature.

These assistants use **machine learning** to adapt to your preferences, making interactions smoother over time.

### Personalized Recommendations
Ever noticed how *Netflix* or *Spotify* seems to *know* you? AI algorithms analyze:

1. Your viewing/listening history
2. Time spent on specific genres
3. User ratings

This creates a tailored experience, whether you’re binge-watching a series or shopping on **Amazon**.
